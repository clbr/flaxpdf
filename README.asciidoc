Please note that this branch is in BETA. Still some work remaining to be done...

FlaxPDF
=======

FlaxPDF is a fast, nice multithreaded PDF viewer for the desktop.

As long as there are more pages than cores, every core will get a workout.

Light on dependencies, trimming borders, and aggressive caching are
its major points. Okular and Evince are nice but heavy; and the point
for starting this project, ePDFview, is dead.

EPDFview was nice and light, but lacking in a couple ways:

- no caching, if you wanted to backtrack one page, it reloaded slowly
- no automatic zoom to content/trim

Now with my main PDF viewer being dead, why not build a fresh one with
those two itches scratched?

Requirements
------------

Poppler, LZO, libconfig++-dev, and FLTK 1.3.

Comparison
----------

Evince 3.10.3, FlaxPDF 0.6.1 and ePDFview 0.1.8 were tested. The same
document was scrolled repeatedly to check the cpu usage, the binary size
was measured, as well as RAM use.

		CPU		RAM		Binary
Evince		90%		56.8 MB		507 KB (evince + libpdfdocument.so)
ePDFView	72%		46.3 MB		124 KB
FlaxPDF		57% (5% *)	36.5 MB		45 KB

* To be fair to all, these measurements were done using the Vesa driver.
FlaxPDF, as the only one of the three, is able to take advantage of the GPU,
dropping its CPU use when scrolling to 5% (tested on radeon).

Installation
============

The following packages are required and may need to be built and installed if not
available as a package:

- poppler (http://poppler.freedesktop.org/poppler-0.48.0.tar.xz)
- fltk 1.3.3 (http://www.fltk.org/software.php?VERSION=1.3.3&FILE=fltk/1.3.3/fltk-1.3.3-source.tar.gz)

The following packages are available via apt-get under linux:

- libconfig++ ("$ sudo apt-get install libconfig++-dev")
- libjpeg ("$ sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev")
- libpng ("$ sudo apt-get install libpng-dev")
- libtiff ("$ sudi apt-get install libtiff-dev")

Poppler
-------

To properly build poppler, some libraries are required to be installed. That's the case for
libjpeg, libpng and libtiff to manage embedded images in PDFs. Other libraries are required 
and are often already installed. Here is a page to get some more informations about the dependencies:

http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/general/poppler.html

Once the popper library is untared, you need to build it with the following commands:

------------------------------------------
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr               \
              --sysconfdir=/etc           \
              --disable-static            \
              --enable-build-type=release \
              --enable-cmyk               \
              --enable-xpdf-headers
$ make
$ sudo make install
------------------------------------------


FLTK
----

The FLTK library is installed using the usual GNU autoconf commands:

--------------------
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
--------------------

FlaxPDF
-------

To install FlaxPDF, the following commands are required:

--------------------
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
--------------------

All the previously indicated libraries must have been installed before building 
the application. The installation will add an entry into the OFFICE main menu of you 
linux installation.
